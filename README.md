A college placement system is a system that helps students to find jobs after they graduate. This system typically involves the college working with employers to identify job opportunities and to match students with those opportunities. The college may also provide students with training and support to help them prepare for the job placement process. The purpose of the Placement Management System website is to overcome the disadvantages of traditional placement system. It enables the end users to register online through their College Management System account which is a website of college created for attendance, term test marks, etc., read and apply for the company of their choice and get frequent updates regarding the placements from college. There is no chance of missing the placement opportunity updates. The college placement officers will not have to get the separately collect information of every student. It will automatically be updated when the student registers. The project is basically a website which can be easily accessed through mobile on the go.
